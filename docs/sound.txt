Well, there is some sound hardware. It is an oscillator circuit which is gated by the Q line of the 1802. 
It can be turned on and off by the 1802 instructions SEQ and REQ respectively.
The sound circuit is based around an NE555, driven in Astable mode, with Ra = 400k, Rb = 480k and C = 1.8pf. This gives a working frequency of 625 Khz. 
To complicate things, the control line (pin 5) of the 555 is connected to 0v via a 10uf Electrolytic capacitor. 
The effect of this is to decay the frequency to about half its standard value in about 0.4 seconds. This gives the peculiar "warpy" effect you hear on power up.

Also, I believe there is a capacitor charging circuit to extend the length of the first "beep" on power up. This is programmed for only 0.08s, but is clearly longer than that.
