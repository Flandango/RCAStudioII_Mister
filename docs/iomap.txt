Port 1. (Input)
Reading this turns on the video circuitry, enabling the 60Hz interrupt which tells the 1802 that it is time for a new video frame. 
The value read is undefined, but the simplest way to turn on video is via CALL $0066 ; this is done by the system BIOS anyway.

Port 2 (Output)
The lower four bits of Port 2 select the keypad number to be read. Both keypads can be read this way. 
The value can be tested via EF3 and EF4 (see below).

EF1 (Input pin)
Goes to logic 1 at the end of the generating code, briefly. This is used to loop the interrupt driven video display continually, 
and check when it is to be terminated. 
It pulses as well when the video is not being displayed, exactly how is unknown.

EF3 (Input pin)
Logic '1' when the selected key on the left hand keypad is pressed

EF4 (Input pin)
Logic '1' when the selected key on the right hand keypad is pressed

Q (Output pin)
Turns the sound off and on. When logic '1', the beeper is on.
