Keyboard
The RCA Studio II uses the 4 to 16 line decoder CD4515 to decode the 20 keys. 
The lower 4 bits of OUT 2 are used as input selecting one of the 16 outputs of the CD4515. 10 of the outputs are connected to both keypads (keys 0 to 9). 
The keys on the left keypad are connected to the EF3 flag and on the right keypad to the EF4 flag. 
The Studio II software checks the keys by stepping OUT 2 from 0 to 9. 
After every OUT, EF3 and EF4 are checked and if equal to 0 the key representing the last OUT 2 and EF was pressed.

To scan a given key, output its "key number" (0-9) to 1802 I/O Port 2. 
Only the four lower bits are significant. The status of the selected key can be obtained either via EF3 (for Player 1, the left handed player), 
and EF4 (for Player 2, the right handed player). Latching and Strobing is done via a 4515 4-16 latch decoder and the array of diodes. 
Whoever designed this had shares in a diode factory, obviously.
The strobing singla is obtained by inverting TPB (4001 gates 4,5,6) and exclusive Noring it with the output of Q1 (see "Decoding"). 
The net effect of this is that it it strobes when TPB = 1, and the "stored" value of N1 is 0.
